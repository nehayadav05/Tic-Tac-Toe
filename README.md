Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created under the guidance of Love Babbar.

How to Play

To play the game, open the index.html file in your web browser. The game board will be displayed, and you can click on any empty cell to make your move. The game alternates between "X" and "O" players. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
